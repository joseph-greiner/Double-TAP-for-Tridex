# Voron Double-Tap
 A version of Voron-Tap for IDEX machines (Tridex)

Double-Tap is a nozzle-based z-probe for Tridex printer design. 
Both toolheads can move up to trigger an optical switch however due to curent klipper limitations only the left toolhead will be used. 


Please see the original Voron-Tap Repo [Here](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Tap)

You only need to download the 2 parts in this repo to get to Double-Tap which replace a part on the original tap ([a]Tap_Center_r6)

[a]T0_Center_r6.stl (the left toolhead) and [a]T1_Center_r6.stl (the right toolhead)

If using tool heads other than Stealthburners, you can download [a]T0_Center_revised_r6.stl, [a]T1_Center_revised_r6.stl, and [a]Endstop_Trigger.stl
Mount the [a]Endstop_Trigger.stl to the right side endstop mount on [a]T0_Center_revised_r6.stl using 2 M2x10 screws. Adjust placement until you are happy with the trigger location of the endstop mounted on [a]T1_Center_revised_r6.stl.

All other assemblies and parts are as the original version of tap so please follow the voron tap manual for full instructions.
